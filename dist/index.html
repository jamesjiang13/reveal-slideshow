          <section>
            <p>Explanation:</p>
            <p>"Confirmation bias is our tendency to cherry-pick information that confirms our existing beliefs or ideas. Confirmation
            bias explains why two people with opposing views on a topic can see the same evidence and come away feeling validated by
            it."</p>

          <section>Selection Bias</section>
          <section>
            <p>Explanation:</p>
            <p>"Selection bias occurs when the study population is not representative of the target population so that the measure of
            risks/benefits does not accurately represent the target population to which conclusions are being extended."</p>

          <section>
            <span>In short: the conclusion drawn is wrong because the test accidentally tested the wrong people.</span>

            <p>Explanation:</p>
            <p>"Survivorship bias is a common logical error that distorts our understanding of the world. It happens when we assume that

          <section>
            <p>Explanation:</p>
            <p>"The Dunning-Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which people wrongly overestimate their knowledge or ability in a
            specific area. This tends to occur because a lack of self-awareness prevents them from accurately assessing their own
            skills."</p>

          <section>
            <p>Explanation:</p>
            <p>"Anchoring is a cognitive bias where an individual depends too heavily on an initial piece of information
            offered to make subsequent judgments during decision making. Once the value of this anchor is set, all future
            negotiations, arguments, estimates, etc. are discussed in relation to the anchor."</p>
